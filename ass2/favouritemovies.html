        <h3> Fav Movie</h3>
        <p>  My Favorite Movies

            One of my favorite movies is **“Inception”** for its intricate plot
            and stunning visual effects. Directed by Christopher Nolan, it
            explores dreams within dreams and challenges perceptions of reality.
            Another favorite is **“The Shawshank Redemption,”** a powerful story
            of hope and friendship set in a prison. Tim Robbins and Morgan
            Freeman deliver unforgettable performances. **“The Lord of the
            Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”** captivates with its epic
            fantasy world and rich storytelling. Finally, **“Amélie”** enchants
            with its whimsical depiction of Paris and a heartwarming tale of
            kindness. These films stand out for their originality, emotional
            depth, and exceptional craftsmanship.</p>
